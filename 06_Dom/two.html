   // Important discussion about NodeList. A nodelist is a collection of document nodes which includes text nodes , attribute nodes and element nodes. A line break is also counted in nodelist but only first one. All subsequent line breaks are ignored by browser
   // Comment nodes as well by the way. And I have a question, you said line break is also counted in nodelist but only the first one but I think all the lines breaks are counted and they are represented as textNode in nodelist. Correct me if i am wrong.
   //  you are right not first one but every line break is counted but if there are multiple ine breakes simultaneously or right after same node than they are ignored
   //  upper hmane parent ke bad line break diya h vo bhi ek node h neter hone ke baad bhiek text node h
